# iDea - Information Dissemination Application

iDea is a robust Information Dissemination Application designed to run within the secure environment of Mountain Top University's (MTU) intranet. It enables controlled and efficient communication within the school community.

## Problem Statement (MTU as a Case Study)

In MTU, the proliferation of inaccurate information has led to various issues, including missed assessments, wasted time for both lecturers and students, missed classes, and scheduling conflicts. For example, it's common for a lecturer to have to call hostel porters to locate a student, regardless of whether the student is in the hostel or not.

## Aim and Objectives

The primary aim of iDea is to address these issues by:

1. Creating an intranet-based information dissemination system tailored for a school where mobile phones are not permitted.
2. Developing a user-friendly system with intuitive interfaces and a range of communication channels for teachers and students.
3. Evaluating the system's effectiveness in enhancing communication and learning, comparing it to traditional methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
